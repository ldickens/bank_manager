# BANK MANAGER


Bank Manager provides a quick means of updating entire banks of the Hippotizer MediaManager component using .csv files to construct the bank contents.
There is an additional "Find and Replace" feature accessible from the RMB menu within the bank table (right-side). For further information read the 
"How to" section below.

### Security
When the application has been downloaded from the web you may find that Windows Defender blocks the .exe. You can right click the .exe file
then select "properties". At the bottom of the window should be an unblock checkbox, select his and apply.

All code in the project has been written by Leon Dickens and therefore I can confirm that the application is safe.



## How To...
### BANK CHANGES:

Input the desired IP address of a networked host device. Select "connect" to pull the media library data to the local software.

Select "Import CSV" to load a list of media, column 1 should be the media names.

Select "Push" to update the current visible bank (right-side) with the imported CSV table of listed clips (left-side).


### FIND AND REPLACE:

In the right-side table select a clip and open the right mouse button menu. Select "Replace".

A new window opens, now select the clip you would like to replace the file with.

This process will replace ALL instances of the replaced clip. The clip still stays in the main media library.
